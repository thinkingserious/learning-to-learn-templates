# Learning Dashboard

## Define the Purpose & Principles

* Why am I doing this?

## Objectives

* What does success look like?
* When does the learning session start and when is it due?

## Measurements

* How will the objectives be measured?

## Resources

Find resources that explain the subject and try to include some of the following types of materials:

* Books and/or book summaries
* Videos
* Articles, Blog Posts, etc...
* MOOCs
* Forums and other communities
* Audio
* Project ideas
* Course notes from others

* [link to resource]

## Develop a Plan

1. Determine the time frame that you have to learn the material
2. Determine how much time you can spend on study each day and include breaks
3. Craft a study session for each day (see the template below)
4. Craft tests to gauge your progress (see the template below)
5. Determine how you will reward you success upon success. Also, provide rewards for milestones.

## Study Session Plan

* Determine the chunks you need to learn
* Determine what you need to memorize
* Is there a [project]() or other hands on activities you can execute to help learn?
* Write a blog post or create a podcast, or something similar, teaching what you learned to others
* Create flash cards (Written and Anki)
* Find a study group where you can be challenged on your knowledge
* Determine which resources you will use to study with
* Can you meet with an expert? Set an appointment if possible, otherwise study their explanations

## During a Study Session

* Execute using the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) to optimize your use of focused and diffuse mode thinking.
* Identify any metaphors or analogies (make them vivid)
* Practice recall by occasionly looking away from the material and recalling what you learned

## Testing Plan

* Quiz yourself with the flashcards you have created
    * No more than a few times per day, one of these times should be right before you go to sleep or nap
    * Shuffle when done
* Find problems where the solution is known and use those as test questions
