This is a set of [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) formatted templates to help you create a learning plan for any subject you wish to master.

These templates are based on the Coursera course titled [Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) by University of California, San Diego and the [Getting Things Done methodology](http://gettingthingsdone.com/fivesteps). As a first step, I suggest you take the Learning How to Learn course, it's only 4 weeks and its free. Reading [David Allen's book on GTD](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KWG9M2E) wont hurt either.

I recommend that you add these templates to a folder titled learning in [TextExpander](https://smilesoftware.com/textexpander).
